##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about ride bookings with the following fields:

- `Booking_ID`, `Date`, `Time`, `Customer_ID`
- `Vehicle_Type`, `Pickup_Location`, `Drop_Location`
- `Booking_Status`, `Canceled_Rides_by_Customer`, `Canceled_Rides_by_Driver`
- `V_TAT`, `C_TAT`, `Incomplete_Rides`, `Incomplete_Rides_Reason`
- `Booking_Value`, `Payment_Method`, `Ride_distance`
- `Ride_Ratings`, `Customer_Ratings`, `Vehicle_Images`

##  Key SQL Operations

- **View 1**: Successful bookings
- **View 2**: Average ride distance per vehicle type
- **View 3**: Total cancelled rides by customers
- **View 4**: Top 5 customers by booking volume
- **View 5**: Cancellations by drivers (personal and vehicle issues)

These queries helped in shaping the KPIs and visuals used in the dashboard.
