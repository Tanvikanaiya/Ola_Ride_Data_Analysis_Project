# Ola Ride Data Analysis Project

##  Power BI Dashboard & SQL Insights

This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride booking data to identify key trends in booking success, ride cancellations, customer behavior, and vehicle performance. It combines SQL for data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization.

---

##  Project Objective

To derive actionable insights from Ola's ride booking data using a combination of SQL and Power BI. The goal is to uncover booking patterns, optimize vehicle usage, and reduce ride cancellations through visual storytelling and data exploration.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL)** ‚Äì Data querying, cleaning, and view creation
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Dashboard design and data visualization
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì For custom KPIs and calculations

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about ride bookings with the following fields:

- `Booking_ID`, `Date`, `Time`, `Customer_ID`
- `Vehicle_Type`, `Pickup_Location`, `Drop_Location`
- `Booking_Status`, `Canceled_Rides_by_Customer`, `Canceled_Rides_by_Driver`
- `V_TAT`, `C_TAT`, `Incomplete_Rides`, `Incomplete_Rides_Reason`
- `Booking_Value`, `Payment_Method`, `Ride_distance`
- `Ride_Ratings`, `Customer_Ratings`, `Vehicle_Images`

---

##  Key SQL Operations

- **View 1**: Successful bookings
- **View 2**: Average ride distance per vehicle type
- **View 3**: Total cancelled rides by customers
- **View 4**: Top 5 customers by booking volume
- **View 5**: Cancellations by drivers (personal and vehicle issues)

These queries helped in shaping the KPIs and visuals used in the dashboard.
